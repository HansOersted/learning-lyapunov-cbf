# Learning Lyapunov Functions from Data

> “My professor asked me to find a Lyapunov candidate.  
> I spent the whole afternoon and missed my date at Tivoli (amusement park in Denmark).  
> Now she says we’re over 💔.”

What used to take a heartbreak 💔 — now takes one command in this repository.


## What It Does


Given the tracking result, this repository automates the search for Lyapunov candidate.  
And it even gives us a PDF report automatically!

## Environment

To run this project successfully, make sure you have the following:

### 🐍 Python

- Python 3.8 or later
- Install dependencies with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 📄 LaTeX

To compile the final report, you need a LaTeX engine and required packages:

```bash
sudo apt install latexmk texlive-latex-base texlive-latex-extra texlive-fonts-recommended
```

## Quick Start

Once your environment is set up, find the Lyapunov candidate in 3 steps:

---

### 1. *(Optional)* Load the tracking result

*To beginners:*  
**Skip this step!** The default tracking result is collected from the flight of a UAV simulator.

*To advanced users:*  
Replace with the interested tracking result for analysis.

---

### 2. Find the Lyapunov candidate

Simply run and wait:

```bash
python3 run_pipeline.py
```

This will generate `lyapunov_training_report.tex` for the next step.

---

### 3. Generate the PDF report

Compile `lyapunov_training_report.tex`:

```bash
latexmk -pdf lyapunov_training_report.tex
```

Finally, a Lyapunov candidate is found with a training report `lyapunov_training_report.pdf`.
